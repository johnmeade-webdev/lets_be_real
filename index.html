                <h3>Acne has been my struggle for the last 9 years, and it used to make me feel like no one would want
                    to love me. Turns out, thats totally not true. My husband proposed to me on my most broken out day
                    of 2016. He looked me in the face, pimples and all, and asked me to spend the rest of my life with
                    him. He could have jumped ship you guys, but he chose to continue loving me instead.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Don't you think you deserve to be loved too? Not just by others, but by yourself. Whatever your
                    insecurity is, whether it's acne, eczema, your weight, your height, anxiety, etc., there are
                    countless things that can cause us to feel unworthy in life. But I'm here to tell you that there is
                    a mighty God who created every intricate part of you on purpose, and he thinks you are a
                    masterpiece.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Let's come together as girls. Let's be on each other's side. Let's encourage one another to be good
                    stewards of the skin, bodies, and personalities that God gave us. </h3>
